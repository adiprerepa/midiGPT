# ðŸŽ¹ midiGPT

Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT), I am building `midiGPT` as a **learning-in-public** project. The goal is to build a from-scratch PyTorch implementation of a decoder-only transformer model (similar to GPT) that generates music as MIDI data. 

# Mini Projects
The [projects](projects) directory contains simple example applications of `midiGPT`, which are being used for development.

## ðŸ“œ Tiny Shakespeare

- example generation:
```
KING JOHNNY:
To be, or not to be: that is the question.
Gentlemen, give me the clothes to wail,
And what I am to receive: to resist this war
To bear himself of God, my worship forth;
Have caught up my state, which have we stood
To take enforce the stones?
```
