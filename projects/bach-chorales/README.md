# ðŸŽ¼ Bach Chorales

The Bach Chorales dataset consists of 382 chorales composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. Each chorale is 100 to 640 time steps long, where each time step contains 4 integers that correspond to a note's index on a piano (except for the value 0, which corresponds to a rest).

I trained a GPT model to generate new Bach Chorales by predicting the next note in sequences of arpeggios. The model had 24 self-attention blocks, each consisting of 8 attention heads and an embedding size of 64. total number of parameters was 622,383.
